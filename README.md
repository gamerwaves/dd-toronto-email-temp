# Daydream assets
Email and letter templates for Daydream Toronto, that can be modified into emails and printouts for other Daydreams too!

## Heads up! 
The files in the "Assets" folder are from Hack Club's official [Daydream](https://github.com/hackclub/daydream) repo. The graphics folder files are made by me
